# Transformers
1. This project could be opened with an up to date Android Studio version as a new project from VCS, with no additional requirenments.
2. I did asume that it is ok to do some shortcuts, regarding the high standars of the production code we usually folow. Simplified atchitecture (no use cases,
few base elements), hardcoded strings in presentation/model layer, no navigation system, no error handling, offline support – well, you got the idea.
But I've ticked to requirenments checkboxes.
3. The structure of the project is pretty simple: it is separated with folders containing different parts of the app structure (like di, network, model),
and those containing features.
